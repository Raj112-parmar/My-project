# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Predicting the estimated delivery time for food orders is crucial for both restaurants and customers. This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts delivery time based on various features such as distance, order preparation time, weather conditions, and restaurant details.

## 📊 Dataset Details
The dataset consists of multiple features that influence food delivery time:
- **Restaurant Location**: The latitude and longitude of the restaurant.
- **Customer Location**: The latitude and longitude of the customer.
- **Order Preparation Time**: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the order.
- **Weather Conditions**: Impact of weather on delivery time.
- **Traffic Conditions**: Influence of traffic on delays.
- **Delivery Distance**: The distance between the restaurant and the customer.
- **Vehicle Type**: Type of vehicle used for delivery.

After data exploration, we identified missing values, outliers, and unnecessary columns, which were cleaned and preprocessed.

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing
### Steps Taken:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing data using appropriate techniques.
2. **Feature Selection**: Dropped irrelevant columns that do not impact delivery time prediction.
3. **Encoding Categorical Data**:
   - Used **Label Encoding** for categorical variables like weather and vehicle type.
4. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features.
5. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

## 🏆 Model Selection & Evaluation
Multiple regression models were trained to predict delivery time. Below are the models used along with their evaluation metrics:

| Model                     | R² Score (Accuracy) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Linear Regression         | 74.5%              |
| Decision Tree Regression  | 78.2%              |
| **Random Forest Regression** | **85.6% (Best Model)** |

- **Linear Regression**: Performed decently but struggled with non-linearity in data.
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Improved accuracy but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Gave the best performance with **85.6% accuracy**, making it the final model for prediction.

## 🔥 Key Insights
- Distance and traffic conditions significantly impact delivery time.
- Weather conditions slightly affect predictions but are not the strongest factors.
- Random Forest Regression provided the best accuracy due to its ability to handle complex patterns in data.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project successfully builds a predictive model for food delivery time estimation. The **Random Forest Regression model** outperforms other models and is recommended for deployment in real-world applications.

## 📂 Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time traffic data for better predictions.
- Improve feature engineering by considering additional factors like rider experience.
- Deploy the model as a web application for live predictions.
